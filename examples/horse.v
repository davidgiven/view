€CEThe Water Horse's Fireplace€CEa Scottish Halloween folk story, sort of€CE(c) 2012 David GivenThe each-uisge of Scotland, pronounced echh-ush-guh , is one of thecountry's traditional monsters. While the relatively harmless kelpie livesin running water, the each-uisge ('water horse') lives in lochs. They eatmeat, human for preference, and will use their shapeshifting powers tolure their prey down to the water's edge where they will be dragged underand consumed, leaving only their livers to float to the shore as a signthat the water horse has taken another victim. Water horses are viciousand terrifying, far more dangerous than many of the other Scottishsupernatural creatures, and the locals would always treat the appearanceof a lone animal or man near the water's edge with caution, for fear thatthe water horse might be hungry again. And rightly so.In a small loch in north-west Scotland whose name I can't quite remember,there once lived a water horse and his wife. They preyed upon the localcrofters, for of course there were no fishermen --- with a pair of waterhorses in the loch venturing into the water was far too dangerous. Luckilyfor the locals, water horses do not get hungry very often.One morning in early October, one of the local crofters was at work in histiny field when he spotted a black pony grazing aimlessly down near thewater. Not being a fool, he realised immediately what it must be. Butstill --- a pony; vast riches to a poor farmer like him. If only he couldfind some way to catch it... and after all, he was a descendant of one ofthe old Celtic saints, a group of men so fearsome as to even put theuncanny to shame.Running home, he found the most sacred item in his house, which was hiswife's wedding shawl. Over her protests he cut it into strips and made amakeshift bridle out of it.He walked nervously down the hill to the pony, which approached him andnuzzled him affectionately. Quickly, he cast the bridle over its head andblessed it in the name of his ancestors. And then he led it home intriumph.The pony was a hard worker, if docile and a little confused, and with itshelp he began to transform his croft, preparing the land for the nextyear's crops. The work was easier than it had ever been before and hecounted the day the water horse had tried to eat him as being the luckiestof his life. Each night he would lead it home, tie it up in a makeshiftstable, and would tie on the bridle and bless it before retiring for thenight, and each morning it would be standing placidly in the stable,blinking into the dawn sunlight.But the nights moved on, and three weeks later All Hallows' Eveapproached: that time of the year when the canny is at its weakest and theuncanny at its strongest. And whether it was that, or the strong drinkthat his neighbours had been plying him with (for he would never tell themhow he had come across his beautiful new pony), or whether it was justthat his wife's shawl was slowly unravelling, that evening when he led thepony into the stable and prepared to tie it up the bridle disintegrated inhis hands. With a mighty whinny, the water horse grabbed the farmer by thescruff of the neck, and leapt into the loch.The water horse pulled the hapless farmer deep down, to the bottom of theloch, a cold, dark place full of slimy things, and to the nasty littlecave where the water horse and his wife lived. He threw the cringingfarmer to the floor."Where have you been?" the water horse's wife demanded (the farmerdiscovering that, surrounded as he was by the water horses' magic, hecould breathe the water and understand their speech). "Three weeks you'veleft me alone here!""This cowardly son of a Christian caught me and has been making me work onhis farm," spat the water horse. "As a draught animal!""Oh, yes," said his wife. "I'm sure that was a hardship, spending all dayout in the warm sunshine and clean air. And I was down here in the coldand the slime and the dark!"As the two water horses continued to argue, the farmer realised that themare had a point: the cave was quite horrible, full of mud and old bonesand little wriggling worms. The only light was a pale green glimmer fromabove that merely made the dark seem darker and the cold colder. But hequickly realised that disagree though they might, the two water horseswere unanimous on one point: that they were going to eat him, leaving onlyhis liver to float ashore as a horrible warning to those who woulddisrespect the uncanny."Don't eat me!" he cried. "I'll do anything you want!""Oh, yes," snarled the water horse. "And what can you possibly do for me?""I can make you a fire!" the farmer blurted out. "To keep you warm!""At the bottom of the loch?" said the water horse. "Don't make me laugh."But the water horse's wife put one hand on her husband's shoulder. "Wait,"she said. And then, to the farmer: "Can you truly do this thing?"The farmer swallowed, wondering what could have possessed him to suggestsuch an impossibility, but then thought that it was either that or beeaten, so he said: "Yes, I can."The water horse's wife approached him. She was a beautiful creature, witha mane like a breaking wave and an eye as deep and dark as the ocean, butthat just made her even more terrifying than her husband. "Swear it onyour god," she said.The farmer swallowed again. Breaking such an oath would be a terrible,terrible thing, but... it was that or be eaten, and besides, he wasdescended from one of the old Celtic saints, and surely God would forgivehim? He closed his eyes, and swore.So the water horses put him to work making a fire, watching him closely toprevent him escaping. And because he had not even the faintest idea how todo such a thing, he first said that he had to build a fireplace, whichfirst needed him to clean out the cave. And that took days. And then hesaid the cave was not suitable, so he had to built a little house outsidethe cave out of lake-bottom rocks and mud, and that took more days, andthen he had to make somewhere to store the firewood, and that put themoment off even longer.And so the days turned into weeks, and after three weeks he ran out ofthings to do and the water horses ran out of patience. The water horsedragged him into the now quite large house he had built for them, andwhile his wife looked on, threw him down in front of the wide fireplace."No more," she said. "Fulfil your oath, or will eat you up here and now."The farmer knelt in front of the fireplace and realised he needed amiracle. So he began to pray."Oh Lord," he said, "Please, please send me a flame, or else the waterhorses will eat me up, all but my liver."But nothing happened."Oh Lord," he said, "I am a descendant of one of the old Celtic saints,one of your great men of wrath. Will you not send me a flame inremembrance of them?"Nothing happened."Oh Lord," he said, "I am sorry for taking your name in vain. I am a weakman and a sinner, and I am very terrified, but please, I need a flame."Still nothing happened.The farmer continued to pray and to beg for mercy until at last herealised that he was not going to get his miracle, and that it was hisfate to be eaten here, by the water horses, all except his liver. And thiswas to be his punishment for his hubris and for taking his God's name invain."Oh Lord," he said at last, "I am a weak and foolish man, but I havesinned and I must pay for my sins. If it is your will that I meet my endhere at the hands of these creatures I will try to do so with dignity."And then he added wistfully: "...and they were so looking forward tohaving a fire, too."With those words an impossible flame appeared in the hearth, immersed inthe water at the bottom of the lake. The farmer gaped at it for a moment,and then began to feed it with the waterlogged wood he had collected, andquickly a fire began to grow in the hearth. Working feverishly hecontinued to add wood until the fire roared and heat filled the room.The farmer finally stepped back, and saw the two water horses gazing inrapture into the golden firelight which filled the little room with a warmglow. They were ignoring him completely, so he watched for a few moremoments, and then jumped out the door and swam for his life.When he finally came ashore and apologised to his wife for leaving heralone to work the croft for three weeks, he was laid up in bed for severaldays with a chill. But from then on he was a much more humble man, and hisneighbours commented how much more pleasant he was to talk to; andwhenever anyone asked him about the old Celtic saints, he would quicklychange the subject.And the water horses? From that moment on, they were never again seen onthe shores of the loch, and the water became safe to fish and even swimin; because even the uncanny know the meaning of gratitude, and those whogaze into a miracle cannot help but be touched by it. But every winter,when the north wind would blow and freeze the loch, there would always bea little round opening in the middle, as if the ice was being melted fromunderneath.                                                                                          
